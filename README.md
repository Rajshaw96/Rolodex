# Rolodex Project

# Overview
The Rolodex project is an interactive web experience designed to provide a captivating entrance animation for the Rolodex website. The animation features a unique transformation of the word "rolodex" into a constellation of dots, offering a visually engaging experience for visitors.

# Features

•Initial Display: The homepage initially displays the word "rolodex" with the 'o's as solid circles.

•Letter Disappearance: Upon clicking, the letters (r, l, d, e, x) slowly fade out, leaving only the 'o's.

•Dot Animation: The 'o's move towards each other and merge into a single dot.

•Constellation Formation: The merged dot then blossoms into a cluster of 28 dots that spread out in a constellation-like pattern.

# Technologies Used

•HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the page.

•CSS: Defines the visual styling and animations, ensuring a responsive design.

•JavaScript: Manages the interactive elements and animations, controlling the transitions and dynamic behaviour of the dots.
